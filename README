Dominion deck randomizer written in Sinatra and jQTouch against a CouchDB
backend.

There's some seed data about the cards in lib/card.rb, but you'll have to
fill in the rest yourself.  (Read: buy the game, it's good.)

Everything is off of /dominion/* because I want to serve static stuff
directly from Apache, and I already use a virtual host for mobile type stuff;
Passenger's RackBaseURI would be set to /dominion.

Required gems:

sinatra
json-pure
couchrest
